== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do I do with this? =

This is used to export the complete CSS file from Genesis Design Palette Pro. Do with it as you please, it's your CSS.

= How do I use the CSS on another site? =

You would need to upload the CSS to the new site and load it. Assuming the CSS file was named `gppro-custom.css` and you uploaded it into your active theme's main folder, the below function would load it.

`
function gppro_load_css() {
	wp_enqueue_style( 'gppro-css', get_bloginfo('stylesheet_directory') . '/gppro-custom.css', array(), null, 'all' );
}
add_action ( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'gppro_load_css', 10 );
`

= I loaded the CSS file but nothing happens. Why? =

The CSS data includes a custom body class `gppro-custom` that needs to be present for the browser to recognize it. Design Palette Pro does this automatically, but if you are loading the exported CSS file somewhere else you will need to add it yourself. You can put the below function in your theme.

`
function gpppro_body_class( $classes ) {
	$classes[]	= 'gppro-custom';

	return $classes;
}
add_filter ( 'body_class', 'gpppro_body_class' );
`
